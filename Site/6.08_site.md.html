**Functional Block Diagram**

![](funcitonal_block_diagram.png)

The MFRC522 RFID reader detects and reads an ID card within its range, sending the information to the ESP32, which parses and encrypts data from the card. The ESP32 then sends that data to the server, which returns a response determining whether the student has access to the dorm. The piezo buzzer and LEDs provide sensory feedback about access to the dorm. The ESP32 is conencted to a battery board that is powered by a battery. We envision our system being used by charging the battery with power from a wall socket consistently while the battery powers the system.

**Extra Parts**
- MFRC522: RFID reader used to read the data from the MIT ID cards.
- Piezo buzzer: Used to provide auditory feedback to both student and security worker.
- Red LED: Used to indicate to the student that he/she cannot enter the dorm.
- Green LED: Used to indicate to the student that he/she can enter the dorm.

Arduino-Side Software
==============================================================
**System Functionality**
![](state_machine_diagram.png)

- When the system is idle, it waits for the RFID reader to detect an ID card within its range.
- When a new card is detected, the system will read the UID (unique ID number) from the raw data in the card, and it will encrypt it using AES encryption.
- Once encrypted, it will send a POST request to the server to determine if the UID of the card has access to the dorm.
- If "True" is returned, the buzzer buzzes for 400 milliseconds and the green LED lights, and, if "False" is returned, the buzzer buzzes for 1500 milliseconds and the red LED blinks. Then, the sytem returns to its idle state.



**Code Explanation**

setup():

- Sets up RFID reader, PWM channels (red LED, green LED, buzzer), and connects to the Wifi.

loop():

- The code loops and continuously checks if a new RFID card has been scanned
- If a new card has been scanned, the returned bytes are converted into an integer ID
- Question marks are then appended onto the end of the ID until the ID is 16 characters long. This is to pad for the encryption, which requires inputs to be a multiple of 16
- The length 16 padded ID is then encrypted and stored in hexadecimal format
- The function sendID() is then called

sendID():
- The ID stored in the UIDstr variable (which will be the hex encrypted ID at this point) and the Dorm are added to the POST body
- The request is then sent to the server
- The server will either return True (which triggers a small beep and the green LED), or something else (which triggers a long beep and the red LED)

**Power**

The power strategy for the tap in system is simple. Since the device is stationary, the device can simply be plugged into a wall outlet. The wall outlet is plugged into the charging port of the battery board, and the battery board is plugged into the ESP. This way, the ESP is constantly running, but if the power in the outlet goes down, the battery pack is directly and automatically used to power the ESP system. In testing, it was found that the tap in system could run on strictly battery power for 7 hours (with a card-tap rate of approximately 5 taps per hour). The RFID reader draws about 30mA while running but has a sleep current of near 0. It is possible then that the 7-hour timeframe could be improved by implementing an improved sleep mechanism for the RFID reader, so that it doesn’t draw 30mA constantly. However, since the system is constantly plugged into a power outlet, there should be no significant issues with the reader drawing too much power, even if it is constantly running at 30mA.

Retrieves every successful dorm access/entry attempt in descending order for the guest worker.



Encryption
==============================================================
**Motivation**

On the ESP side of the system, the only piece of data collected from an ID tap is the user’s hashed ID number. To make the project more versatile to application in a campus-wide system, we decided to encrypt the data going from the ESP to the server. We wanted to protect, the potentially sensitive information [^syntax] of the identity of individuals visiting dorms from man-in-the-middle attacks betweent the ESP and the server.

**Implementations**

**Implementation One: Vigenere Cipher**

Our first implementation of an encryption cipher was the vigenere cipher for encrypting ID numbers on the ESP side and decrypting them on the server. The plaintext is taken in to the vignere cipher and shifted with a traditional Caeser Cipher method. However, the security upgrade comes from the nonuniform shift of the each plaintext characters; they are shifted based on the decimal representation of a predetermined key.
Below is a screenshot of the ESP-side code used to encrypt using a Vigenere Cipher. The ciphertext is sent to the server and decrypted to match users with their ID in the database.
![Vignere Cipher Source Code (Arduino Side): Arduino code used to encrypte plaintext (student ID) before sending it up to the server. Click to enlarge.](Vignere_Cipher.jpg)


On the serverside the ciphertext is decrypted using on the same agreed upon keyword and reversing the direction of the shift in the alphabet. This can be used to store the student’s ID in the database so that it can match with ID numbers inputted in the webform.

Below is a screeenshot of the python decryption functions used in companion with the cipher Arduino code. In both the .ino and .py implementations, the keyword for encryption and decryption is decided preimplementaion.

**Drawbacks**

Although we first wanted to implement the Vignere Cipher, the encryption scheme was too basic for our implementations. With a brute force approach, the keyword could be cracked allowing potentially sensitive data to be read before going into the database.

**Implementation 2: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**

With the second implementation, we decided to use another symmetric key algorithm known as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). We implemented a 128 bit AES encryption scheme in the Electronic Codebook (ECB) method. In this method, the plaintext if first broken up into 16 byte blocks that are each decoded individually. It is a symmetric system that uses the same key for both encrypting and decrypting messages on the server and arduino sides.

Once the main 16 byte key is decided, it is stored as a 16 byte (4x4) array with each byte representing a word. Next, the 16-byte key is expanded into 44 subkeys with an objective. Sets of 4 subkeys are used in each of the ten round of the encryption (four in each of 10 rounds) and four in the pre-round step. The first 16-byte block is taken from the plaintext and the XOR operation is used between each collumn in the plaintext array and the corresponding subkey.

**Round Operations**
<center>![Flow diagram for round operations. In our 128 bit encryption, 10 rounds were used.](AES_Structure.jpg width="400px" border="3")</center>


In our 128-bit system a set of functions are preformed once in each of 10 rounds to encrypt the data. The original plaintext array is modified in each of these steps and is referred to as a State Array in the intermediate steps before becoming the final cipher text array

In each round, the Substitution Bytes or SubBytes operation (the first step) involves breaking up each byte into its first four and last four bits. The first four bits are converted into a decimal number from 0 to 15 and the last four numbers are converted to a decimal. The two numbers give a row and collumn location in a predefined matrix. The byte is substituted by the value at this matrix position. This matrix is known as an S-box and is agreed upon beforehand with the key.

The next operation is the Shift Row operation which shifts the bytes in the State Array depending on the row number; Row zero is not shifted while rows one, two, and three are shifted one, two, and three bytes respectively to the left. This creates a further encrypted matrix with shifted rows. The diagram below shows a sample state matrix a and the associatied scrambling after the Shift Row Operation.


![ShfitRowOperation transformation of 4x4 state matrix](Shift_Row.png width = "800 px" border="3")


Next, the state array undergoes the mix collumn step to further encrypt the data. In this step, each collumn (4 bytes) is multiplied by the Circulant MDS Matrix to diffiuse the data. The matrix maximizes the diffusion of the data bytes multiplied in. Below the r vector represents the result and the a vector represents a collumn from the status array.


![Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrix used to diffuse each collumn vector from the state matrix.](Mix_Collumns.jpg width = "300 px" border="3")




Finally, in the AddRoundKey step the 4 subkeys used in the round are combined with the status matrix. Each collumn of the state array is comined with a collumn from the key using an xor operation.

**Padding**

The 128 bit implementation of AES require each block size to be 16 bytes long. Before encrypting the data, we padded the array with extra information to make each string length 16 characters. On the decryption side, we also had to remove these paddings from the array before using the plaintext.

**Coded Examples**

On the server side, we used a function with the symmetric key and ciphertext as parameters. We imported the Crypto.Cipher module and used the mbedtls module and AES library which completes the AES (ECB) encryption.

On the arduino side, we used the same symmetric key to encrypt the data before sending it. We utilized AES lib

Credits
==============================================================
We'd like to thank the entire 6.08 staff for their support, encouragement, and constructive feedback throughout the course and the final project. We would be remiss if we did not call to attention the efforts of our project mentors who kept us on track weekly as well as Joe Steinmeyer for his guidance.

[^syntax]: The MIT ID parsed from the RFID scan is a hashed version of each student’s ID; our encryption mechanisms (and project) pretend that this hashed ID is the student’s actual ID. When we refer to the student’s ID we are in fact referring to the 9-digit hashed ID.
